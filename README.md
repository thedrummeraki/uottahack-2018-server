# uottahack-2018-server
Welcome to our uOttaHack Winter 2018 server-side project!

### About
This is very short documentation explaining how this (side-) project works. This is basically the server-side of the [uOttHack-2018 Android application](https://github.com/thedrummeraki/uottahack-2018) that allows ticket management. This server-side, running Ruby on Rails 5, returns JSON to the client. Below are listed the possible endpoints.
